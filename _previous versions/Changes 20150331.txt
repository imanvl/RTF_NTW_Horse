27 October 2014
=============================
Who made the change(s):
- Kartik Anand

Files changed / added / removed:
- horseMaster_13 (changed)

- All master codes for the individual approaches e.g. anancode, battcode etc (changed)
- moved debtrank\statistics folder to \unusedalgorithms as it is not used (removed)

Notes:
- The fitness metric in the batt code has been updated.
- Added as an output how long each code took to run.
