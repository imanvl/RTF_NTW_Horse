Subject: Network reconstruction

Dear Iman,

it was nice talking to you. I attach the recent paper about the
network reconstruction method.

The code implementing the method in Matlab can be found at
http://www.mathworks.it/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46912-max-sam-package-zip

That code actually does much more than described in the paper, but
using the option "ECM" (standing for "Enhanced Configuration Model")
it can solve the equations needed to implement the reconstruction
method.

If there is any chance you can add this method to the set of competing
methods, that would be great!

Best regards

Diego
